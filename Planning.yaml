GroupAssignment:
  MainComponent:
  File_IO:
    req1: we will use C++
    req2: we are working with std::string type.
    BigTask: write a C++ class to work with files.
      - create header and source file for C++ class
      - create an empty class.
      - create a source file for main function and some tests.
      - include neccessary header files
      - define main function and create an object of a class for file File_IO
      - ?build it and see at least some output
      - checkpoint
      - add constructor and destructor for a Class. 
      - choose a class as a container for strings (std::list, std::vector, etc)
      - define 4 functions with almost empty body and maybe debug prints
      - add a logic to open and close a file 
      - implement the 4 functions correctly (split into snall sub-tasks if needed)
      -  ?build a class as a library, build main function with linking a labirary
      - rewrite a functinliaty for main cfunction to be as "echo"
