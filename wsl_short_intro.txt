We are using "bash" shell in a linux terminal. 

To see a content of a current directory, we are using ls
$ ls

to change a direcvtory to another, we are using tis command:
$ cd <destination folder>

Note:
We can access Windows folders by path:

/mnt/c/ .... 

$ cd /mnt/c


to create a folder we are using the following command:
$ mkdir <name of folder>
for example:
$ mkdir dev


We are using /mnt/c/dev as a main folder for our projects.
Each project should have it's own folde. An example of folder structure:
/mnt/c/dev/ .
     . Project1
          . Project1_git_repo
          .Project1_local_copy and etc.
     . Project2
        . Project2 _git_ repop
        . Project2_local_copy

: goal: create a folder for "assignment_in_dev"
git repo: "assignment_in_dev"
